## Personal Buttsbot to replace the depreciated version.

### Twitch chatbot that copy's a random user's message, randomly replaces syllables with the word "BUTT" (by default), and spits the message back out (HILARIOUS RIGHT?!?).

### Commands:
- !join - Summons the bot to the user's channel (typed in the bot's chat)
- !leave - Dismiss ButtsBorg (typed in the broadcaster's chat)
- !buttword - Displays the current word being used ('BUTT' is DEFAULT)
- !buttword (word) - replaces the current word with the newly typed one
- !rate - Displays the rate at how many messages will pass before you can expect a response (30 is DEFAULT)
- !rate (number from 5-1000)

### Recent Updates:
- ✅ Remove the chance of auxillary verbs being replaced (in most cases it doesn't work too well)
- ✅ Improve the illegal word list
- ✅ Only the streamer can use !buttrate
- ✅ Global vars for upper/lower buttrate limits and BUTTs per sentence
- ✅ Better documentation of the message and word/syllable replacement process

### Soon:
- Add a !pause command so the user can keep their settings but pause the bot from responding
- Better word/syllable selection for multiple BUTTs in a sentence (i.e. make sure they aren't side by side)
