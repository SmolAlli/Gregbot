## Personal Buttsbot to replace the depreciated version.

### Twitch chatbot that randomly replaces syllables in a user's sentence with the word "BUTT" (by default).

### Commands:
- !join - Summons the bot to the user's channel (typed in the bot's chat)
- !leave - Dismiss Buttsbot (typed in the broadcaster's chat)
- !buttword - Displays the current word being used ('BUTT' is DEFAULT)
- !buttword (word) - replaces the current word with the newly typed one
- !rate - Displays the rate at how many messages will pass before you can expect a response (30 is DEFAULT)
- !rate (number from 5-1000)

### Future updates:
- Remove the chance of auxillary verbs being replaced (in most cases it doesn't work too well)
- Add a !pause command so the user can keep their settings but pause the bot from responding
